Currently, if user create new expense sheet first, and then click to add expense lines,
System will popup a selection window (many2many widget) allowing user to select the existing expenses first, and also to create new expense.

This can be confusing for some user, and might not be suitable for some use case.

With this module, user have option to directly add new lines on expense report (one2many widget).
