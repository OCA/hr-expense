    # The module hr_expense_payment function is to link the generated payments
    # with it's corresponding expense sheet.
    # So when you want to cancel payments associated to a expense_sheet,
    # you need to know which payments are related with your expense sheet.
    # And that information is not available by inheriting hr_expense alone, we need the module
