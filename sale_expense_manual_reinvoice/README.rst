With this module Expense products can be configured to not reinvoice expenses
automatically. Instead, they will be listed in a new menu **Expenses to Reinvoice**
for a manager to manually review them and either reinvoice or discard them.

Configuration
=============

On the **Expense Product**, set the **Re-invoice Mode**:

* Automatically: Expenses are automatically re-invoiced when they're posted (standard)
* Manually: Expenses have to be manually re-invoiced by a manager

Usage
=====

After Expenses of products configured with **Manual** Re-invoice Mode have been
approved and posted, find them under the **Expenses to Reinvoice** menu.

Review their **Customer to reinvoice** field, select the ones you want to process
and click either **Reinvoice** or **Discard**

Discarded expenses will be hidden from the list, but you can still access them by
removing the default search filter.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Some abstraction could be done to have the same mechanism work for all reinvoiceable
analytic lines, like the ones generated from purchase invoices.
